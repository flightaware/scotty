Bugs
====

Debian
------

- Installing libsmi2-dev makes build break.

MacOSX
------

### Tmn::dns

The `dns -server arg` option seems to mess up name server resolution
on MacOSX, so we disable all tests and uses in tests/dns.test with
knownBugMacOSX.


### Tnm::icmp

There seems to be a problem with `nmicmpd`/Tnm::icmp for unreachable
IP's.  While on the other (two) platforms the command times out
gracefully, on MacOSX an error is thrown:

`nmicmpd: failed to send ICMP message`

Disabled with knownBugMacOSX in 8 occurrencies in tests/icmp.test

### Tnm::mib

The `mib format BinaryValue` command fails strangely and is disabled
with knownBugMacOSX.

`
==== mib-7.14 FAILED
mib format BinaryValue 12345
---- Result was:
1100000011100100000000000000000011000000111001
---- Result should have been (exact matching):
11000000111001

==== mib-7.15 mib format FAILED
mib format BinaryValue -12345
---- Result was:
-1100000011100100000000000000000011000000111001
---- Result should have been (exact matching):
-11000000111001
`

### Tnm::snmp

The `snmp expand` command fails on *32 types and on TimeTicks type for
some values.  Respective testcases are disabled with knownBugMacOSX.

`
==== snmp-X.1 snmp Unsigned32 type FAILED
list [catch {snmp expand {{1.3 Unsigned32 4294967296}}} msg] $msg
---- Result was:
0 {{1.3 Unsigned32 4294967296}}
---- Result should have been (exact matching):
1 {unsigned value too large to represent}

==== snmp-X.6 snmp Gauge32 type FAILED
list [catch {snmp expand {{1.3 Gauge32 4294967296}}} msg] $msg
---- Result was:
0 {{1.3 Gauge32 4294967296}}
---- Result should have been (exact matching):
1 {unsigned value too large to represent}

==== snmp-X.11 snmp Counter32 type FAILED
list [catch {snmp expand {{1.3 Counter32 4294967296}}} msg] $msg
---- Result was:

---- Result was:

---- Result should have been (exact matching):
1 {unsigned value too large to represent}
`

### Tnm::udp

Two of the three `udp receive` tests fail: udp-7.1, udp-7.3, with:

`errorCode: POSIX EAGAIN {resource temporarily unavailable}`

on the final `u receive`.  They are disabled with knownBugMacOSX.

- upd-7.1:
  `udp create -myaddress 127.0.0.1 -myport 1234`
  `send 127.0.0.1 1234 "nase"`

- upd-7.3:
  `udp create -myaddress 127.0.0.1 -myport 1234`
  `send 127.0.0.1 1234  [binary format "H*" "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"]`

Note: upd-7.2 uses -myport 1235, then -myport 1236 and connects the
    latter to 1235.

- udp-7.2 is "flaky" - sometimes it works, sometimes it fails like the above.
  For now we disable it too.

### Build

Manuals are install in /Library/Tcl/share/man, where they are not
found by man(1).

FreeBSD 10.3
------------

### Tnm::netdb

Tests netdb-6.6 and netb-6.7 consume all available memory and then
scotty gets killed. (netdb ip).  Note: tested on a 64 bit
architecture.   However on Ubuntu 16.10 this does not occur, on NetBSD it does

The same behaviour is found also on the original scotty (flightaware).


FreeBSD 11
----------

### Tnm::udp

Tests:
- udp-11.2.2 udp configure/send: send to connected
- udp-11.2.3 udp configure/send: send to configured, connected

Fail with: POSIX EADDRINUSE {address already in use}.

Note: these use the same udp endpoint to send and receive.  Might just
rewrite the tests.

### Tests

If tests are run with: `scotty3.0.2 all.tcl` we get a segfault on exit.

### Build

Man files are install in a place, where they cannot be seen
(`/usr/local/share/man/mann`).


Generic
-------

### Build
- Should we revamp directory tree of installed files to reflect FHS or
  so (`share` instead of `library` ...)?
- shell target: does not work.  Make the SCRIPT variable load Tnm.
- Check for missing install targets/routines.  Notably: scotty
  invocation after installing MIBs, man pages
- On MacOSX we get two directories which should be cleaned:
  `nmicmpd.dSYM` and `nmtrapd.dSYM`.
- Consider eliminating the zlib check.  zlib seems not to be used
  at all.
- We could clean up the Makefile, now that everything builds ok.


Tnm::dns
--------

- (obsolete) dns hinfo command returns errorCode but the error message
   is a domain name, seemingly from the soa record, example:

	`$ host -t hinfo iana.org
	iana.org has no HINFO record
	`
	`scotty% dns hinfo iana.org
	sns.dns.icann.org
	`

	We have already changed the code, so we get correctly "not found",
    however it is not tested with a real hinfo record.

- If a dns lookup for an Internet host in a test fails we should skip
  further tests with Internet lookups since they probably will fail
  too.

- Tests for CNAME, NS, and TXT are missing.

- "Real World" tests are done against fixed names/IP's, these might
  change, disappear or be redirected.  We should test e.g. against a
  `tinydns` or `dnsmasq` setup.


Tnm::icmp
---------

- test/icmp.test seems to use 182.168.173.173 as invalid (never
  reachable) IP addresses.  Maybe because 173 is a prime number.
  Well, when configuring private networks I always use prime numbers
  since nobobdy else does, right?  The computer where I write this
  note has IP 192.168.173.53...

  We should use invalid IP's from RFC5737: 192.0.2.0 instead.
 

Tnm::mib
--------

- At the end of tnmOidObj.c there is a #if/else/endif where
  inconditionally the Oid strings are glued together with '::' instead
  of '!'.  Thus, the returned strings do not conform to the standard
  notation and cannot be used as direct input to Tnm::mib function.

  Ok: not so fast.  The following tests show, that at least some input
  on `mib macro` is allowed to use '::'. 

	`
	scotty% mib macro SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr
	OBJECT-TYPE
	scotty% mib macro SNMPv2-MIB!sysDescr
	OBJECT-TYPE
	scotty% mib macro SNMPv2-MIB::coldStart
	NOTIFICATION-TYPE
	scotty% mib macro SNMPv2-MIB!coldStart
	NOTIFICATION-TYPE
	scotty% mib macro SNMPv2-MIB!DisplayString
	TYPE-ASSIGNEMENT
	scotty% mib macro SNMPv2-MIB::DisplayString
	unknown MIB node or type "SNMPv2-MIB::DisplayString"
    `

	Setting the "1" to "0" in tnmOidObj.c yields an error in test case
    mit-31-23:

	`UpdateStringProc for type 'tnmOid' failed to create a valid string rep`

- mib parser hangs, in test cases mib-9.1, mib-9.2

- mib walk hangs, test case mib-21.6

- Test case mib-5.5 shows a "TEXTUAL-CONVENTION" for
  SNMPv2-TC!DisplayString, however `mib macro` returns:
  TYPE-ASSIGNMENT.  This might be traceable to: tnmMibParser.c:929,
  see the surrounding text there.

- Test case mib-37.3 seems to indicate, that `mib size` files on SIZE
  specifications with one exact value.  In this case
  'SNMPv2TC!MacAddress' with: `SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))`.


Tnm::netdb
----------

- services: check netdb-3.8 fails when ports are doubly assigned -
  check disabled.  Should be rewritten.
  
  Some ports are double assigned: e.g. 'pipe-server' and 'search' to
  port 2010.  The first check fail on these.

  Some service names double as aliases: e.g.: dicom

  `acr-nema              104/tcp dicom`

  `dicom                 11112/tcp`

  The second check fail on these.

- services: check netdb-3.9 fail when protocols are doubly
  assigned - check disabled.

- networks: check netdb-7.5 fails entirely, disabled.  Looked up
  results seem strange:

	`
	scotty% netdb networks address loopback
	0.0.0.127
	`

- networks: check netdb-7.6 ditto (as netdb-7.5)

- protcols: check netdp-8.5 disabled.  Protocols ip and hopopt have
  the same number, check should be rewritten.
 
  `
  ip                    0 IP
  hopopt                0 HOPOPT
  `

Tnm::ntp
--------

Seems not to work at all.  I get my time synchronized on my network
via pool.ntp.org, but Tnm::ntp does not reach any of the hosts.


Tnm::smx
--------

Doesn't work at all: `smx peer gone away`.

Test suite disabled smx.test -> l.smx.test


Tnm::snmp
---------

- snmp-2.8 snmp alias FAIlLED
- snmp-2.9 snmp alias FAILED

  `snmp generator -alias focal` does not return a SNMP generator
  session handle at all.

- snmp-X.21 snmp Counter64 type FAILED
	`
	list [catch {snmp expand {{1.3 Counter64 18446744073709551616}}} msg] $msg
	---- Result was:
	0 {{1.3 Counter64 18446744073709551616}}
	---- Result should have been (exact matching):
	1 {unsigned value too large to represent}
	`

-  snmp-X.31 snmp ObjectIdentifier type FAILED
   list [catch {snmp expand {!@#foo!@#} msg} ] $msg
	   `---- Result was:
	   1 {invalid object identifier "1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1"}
	   ---- Result should have been (exact matching):
	   1 {invalid object identifier "!@#foo!@#"}
	   `
   Strange: this is exactly the result expected by snmp-x30!


- snmp-5.7 snmp varbind list expansion FAILED
- snmp-5.8 snmp varbind list expansion FAILED

	`---- Result was:
	{1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3 Integer32 rfc877x25}
	---- Result should have been (exact matching):
	{1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3 Integer32 5}
	`

Should this be a MIB related problem?

- snmp-8.3 snmp oid FAILED
- snmp-8.4 snmp oid FAILED
- snmp-9.4 snmp type FAILED
- snmp-10.4 snmp value FAILED

  Probably MIB related problems too

- snmp.test file has an annex section of tests.  Merge/cleanup?


Tnm::sunrpc
-----------

All subcommands of sunrpc segfault when called
- with wrong arguments
- inside a catch {} argument
- if there are less then the required number of arguments
- on the first run.

If you catch a call with *more* then the required numbers of
arguments, or a catch with any nonsense e.g.: `catch {bad workaround}`
no more segfault occurs.  Hover n the test file, at any other time we
got another segfault.  So the respective tests are disabled with the
custom constraint: `runWithEvilCatchCrashWorkaround`

This seems like some initialization (missing) issue.


Wishlist
