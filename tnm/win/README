This is the directory where you can compile the Windows NT versions of
the Tnm extension for Tcl/Tk and the Tkined network editor. This
directory also contains source files specific to Windows NT.


1. Introduction
---------------

This is the directory where you configure and compile the Windows
version of the Tnm Tcl extension. This directory also contains source
files for Tnm that are specific to Microsoft Windows. The rest of
this file contains information specific to the Windows version of Tcl.


2. Distribution notes
---------------------

The Windows port of the Tnm extension is distributed as part of the
common source release. It contains a makefile which assume that you
have installed the Tcl/Tk binary release available from Sun
Microsystems in C:\Tcl. You need to make some adjustments in case you
have installed Tcl/Tk somewhere else. The Tnm extension will be
compiled into a dynamic loadable library (dll). No main scotty program
is compiled since there is no support for a completely event driven
Tcl interpreter on the Windows platform in the current Tcl/Tk release.


3. Compiling Tnm and Tkined
---------------------------

In order to compile Scotty for Windows, you need the following items:

	Tcl 8.3 Binary Distribution (plus any patches)

	Visual C++ 2.x/4.x/6.x

In this "win" subdirectory of the source release, you will find a
makefile suitable for MS Visual C++. You can use "nmake" to build the
dynamic link libraries.

You also need to install the oncrpc.lib file derived from the ONC RPC
port to Windows NT done by Martin F. Gergeleit and the resolv.lib file
derived from the bind-4.9.4 port to NT. These files are available from
ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de in /pub/local/tkined/Win32 for the Visual C++
compiler (vclibs.zip). The URL is:

	ftp://ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/tkined/Win32/vclibs.zip

More information about the oncrpc port to NT can be found at:

	http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks/english/oncrpc.html

Information about the bind resolver and the port to Windows NT
can be found at:

	http://www.vix.com/isc/bind.html

Note that you have to hack the sources a bit in order to compile the
oncrpc.lib and resolv.lib archives needed for the Tnm port.


4. Open Tnm portability problems
--------------------------------

1. The snmp command crashes in the snmp test suite.

2. The snmp command does not allow to receive traps by more than one
   application.

3. The icmp command does not support all options (timestamp, mask).

The Windows NT porting project has been sponsored by Optical Data
Systems (http://www.ods.com). Gaertner Datensysteme sponsored further
development of the Windows NT port and provides a binary installer
version which is easy to install and use.
