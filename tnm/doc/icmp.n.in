.SH NAME
Tnm::icmp \- Send ICMP messages to hosts on the Internet.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Tnm::icmp command allows to send Internet Control Messages (ICMP)
(RFC 792, RFC 1122) to a list of hosts on the Internet. ICMP messages
can be used to check whether hosts are reachable. The Tnm::icmp
command can also be used to trace routes to Internet hosts by sending
UDP datagrams to unused UDP ports and interpreting the ICMP responses
(Van Jacobsen and Steve Deering algorithm).

.SH ICMP COMMAND
The Tnm::icmp command always accepts a list of target hosts. ICMP
messages are send to the targets in a round-robin fashion which allows
to check entire IP address ranges or a list of core routers
efficiently. The user of the Tnm::icmp command should be careful not
to flood a network with ICMP requests.
.TP
\fBTnm::icmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
Invoking the \fBTnm::icmp\fR command with options but without any
command arguments allows to retrieve and change the default
values. See the description of supported options below. Default values
are bound to a Tcl interpreter which allows to have multiple Tcl
interpreter with different defaults.
.TP
\fBTnm::icmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBecho\fR \fIhosts\fR
The \fBTnm::icmp echo\fR command can be used to test the reachability
of IP devices by sending ICMP echo requests to the \fIhosts\fR.  The
command returns a flat list of host / round trip time pairs. The round
trip time is returned in milliseconds. An empty round trip time value
indicates that a host did not respond in the timeout interval.
.TP
\fBTnm::icmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBmask\fR \fIhosts\fR
The \fBTnm::icmp mask\fR command sends ICMP mask requests and returns
a flat list of host / netmask pairs. An empty list element is returned
instead of a netmask if a host does not respond to ICMP mask requests.
.TP
\fBTnm::icmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBtimestamp\fR \fIhosts\fR
The \fBTnm::icmp timestamp\fR command retrieves timestamps using the
ICMP timestamp request. This command returns an estimate of the time
difference between local time and the time on the hosts given in
\fIhosts\fR. The command returns a flat list of host / time offset
pairs. The time offset is returned in milliseconds. An empty list
element indicates that a host did not respond in the timeout interval.
.TP
\fBTnm::icmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBttl\fR \fInum\fR \fIhosts\fR
The \fBTnm::icmp ttl\fR command, which may not be supported on every
operating system, sends a UDP packet to a presumably unused port
number with the time to live field of the IP header set to
\fInum\fR. The minimal value of \fInum\fR is 1 with the meaning of
this host and the maximal value is 255. This command returns a flat
list of host / round trip time pairs, where the host is the IP device
being \fInum\fR hops away. The round trip time is returned in
milliseconds. An empty list element indicates that a host did not
respond in the timeout interval.
.TP
\fBTnm::icmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBtrace\fR \fInum\fR \fIhosts\fR
The \fBTnm::icmp trace\fR command works similar to the Tnm::icmp ttl
command but it always returns the destination address even when the
responding host chooses another interface with a different IP address
to send the reply. This can be used to trace a route to a host since
the command returns the host that discards the packet if it does not
reach the destination.

.SH ICMP OPTIONS
The following options control how ICMP requests are send and how the 
Tnm::icmp command deals with lost ICMP packets.
.TP
.BI "-timeout " time
The \fB-timeout\fR option defines the time the Tnm::icmp command will
wait for a response. The \fItime\fR is defined in seconds with a
default of 5 seconds.
.TP
.BI "-retries " number
The \fB-retries\fR option defines how many times a request is
retransmitted during the timeout interval. The default \fInumber\fR of
retries is 2.
.TP
.BI "-delay " time
The \fB-delay\fR option defines the minimum delay between two outgoing
ICMP packets. The delay \fItime\fR is defined in milliseconds with a
default delay of 0 milliseconds. Delays are useful to reduce the load
on intermediate devices like gateways or bridges.
The maximal delay value supported is 255.
.TP
.BI "-size " number
The \fB-size\fR option allows to control the size of ICMP packets. The
\fInumber\fR defines the size of ICMP packets in bytes with a default
size of 64 bytes. Sizes smaller than 64 bytes are silently rounded to
64 bytes and sizes larger than 65535 bytes are silently rounded to
65535 bytes.
.TP
.BI "-window " size
The \fB-window\fR option allows to define a window which limits the
number of active asynchronous ICMP requests. This can be used to
prevent scripts from flooding a network with ICMP messages. The
\fBTnm\fR extension queues ICMP requests internally so that no more
than \fIsize\fR ICMP requests are on the wire. Setting the size to 0
turns the windowing mechanism off. The default window size is 10.
The maximum window size is 65535.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Tnm::icmp forks the nmicmpd(8) daemon to do the real work. It looks up
the path to nmicmpd(8) in the environment variable
.BI TNM_NMICMPD
if it exists, otherwise a compiled in path is tried.

.SH BUGS
The Tnm::icmp command requires the setuid root program nmicmpd(8) on
UNIX systems because sending icmp packets requires access to raw
sockets. The Windows version of this command uses the icmp.dll which
does not support accurate round trip time measurements. The icmp.dll
does not allow to implement all the command options described in this
man page. The time returned for the echo and ttl command is silently
adjusted to 1 ms if a value less than 1 ms is received. The Windows
implementation also requires longer time intervals to timeout icmp
requests than the UNIX version.
