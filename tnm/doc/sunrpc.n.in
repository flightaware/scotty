.SH NAME
Tnm::sunrpc \- Call and probe selected Sun RPC services.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Tnm::sunrpc command allows to call and probe selected Sun RPC
(RFC 1831, RFC 1832) services.

.SH SUNRPC COMMAND
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc info \fIhost\fR
The \fBTnm::sunrpc info\fR command returns a list of all registered Sun RPC
services on \fIhost\fR. Each list element contains the program number,
the program version, the protocol name, the port number and the name
of the RPC service. The command fails, if \fIhost\fR is unknown or if
the portmapper does not respond to our request.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc probe \fIhost\fR \fIprogram\fR \fIversion\fR \fIprotocol\fR
The \fBTnm::sunrpc probe\fR command tests a Sun RPC service identified
by \fIprogram\fR \fIversion\fR \fIprotocol\fR on \fIhost\fR by calling
procedure 0. This command returns a list of two elements. The first
element is the time needed to complete the RPC call (measures in
milliseconds). The second list element is a string which describes if
the probe was successful.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc stat \fIhost\fR
The \fBTnm::sunrpc stat\fR command makes an rstat RPC call to \fIhost\fR
and returns a list of name type value triples describing the status of
the remote machine. This command fails if \fIhost\fR is not reachable
or does not support the rstat service.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc mount \fIhost\fR
The \fBTnm::sunrpc mount\fR command retrieves a list of all NFS file systems 
currently mounted from \fIhost\fR. Each element of the list includes
the directory name and the host which serves the directory.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc exports \fIhost\fR
The \fBTnm::sunrpc exports\fR command retrieves a list of all NFS file
systems exported by \fIhost\fR. Each element of this list contains the
exported directory name and the list of hosts that are allowed to
mount the exported directory. An empty host list means that an
exported directory can be mounted by everyone.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc ether \fIhost\fR \fBopen
.ns
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc ether \fIhost\fR \fBstat
.ns
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc ether \fIhost\fR \fBclose
The \fBTnm::sunrpc ether\fR command allows to query an etherd daemon
for ethernet statistics. You first have to register at the remote
etherd using the \fBopen\fR command option. Afterwards, you can query
the etherd using the \fBstat\fR command option, which will return a
list of name type value triples describing the packets counted since
the last query. You should unregister at the remote etherd using the
\fBclose\fR option once you are no longer interested in ethernet
statistics.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc pcnfs \fIhost\fB info \fR[\fIarray\fR]
.ns
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc pcnfs \fIhost\fB list \fR[\fIarray\fR]
.ns
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc pcnfs \fIhost\fB queue \fIprinter\fB \fR[\fIarray\fR]
.ns
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc pcnfs \fIhost\fB status \fIprinter\fB \fIarray\fR
The \fBTnm::sunrpc pcnfs\fR command allows to retrieve printer status
information provided by the pcnfsd daemon. The first command retrieves
the daemon identification. The optional \fIarray\fR variable will be
filled with details about the supported procedures. The second command
returns the list of all printer names known by the pcnsfd daemon on
\fIhost\fR. The optional \fIarray\fR is indexed by printer name and
contains additional information about each printer. The queue
subcommand retrieves the \fIprinter\fR queue and returns the actual
queue length. Information about queued print jobs is written to the
\fIarray\fR variable if given. The array is indexed by the queue
position and contains information about the print job in key value
pairs. The last pcnfs command retrieves \fIprinter\fR specific status
information about the printer itself. The status is written into the
\fIarray\fR variable.
