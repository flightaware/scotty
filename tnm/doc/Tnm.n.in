.SH NAME
Tnm \- Tcl extensions for network management applications.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Tnm Tcl extensions has been written to simplify the development of
network management applications. The primary goal of the Tnm extension
is to provide a string-based API to access network protocols and
services relevant for network management applications.  Some of the
Tcl commands provided by the Tnm extension are useful for more general
networked applications as well.
.PP
A string-based API simplifies the development of site specific
management solutions because higher-level interfaces encapsulate the
complexity of some of the protocols supported by the Tnm extension.
The use of the Tcl language allows to integrate this extension with
the Tk toolkit. Management applications can thus be prototyped in a
cost-effective and platform independent way.

.SH COMMAND OVERVIEW
Below is a short overview over the Tcl commands provided by the Tnm
extension. There is a separate man page for each command listed below
which describes the command and its options in more detail.
.TP 14
.B Tnm::dns
Query the Domain Name System of the Internet.
.TP
.B Tnm::icmp
Send ICMP messages to hosts on the Internet.
.TP
.B Tnm::ined
Access and manipulate tkined objects.
.TP
.B Tnm::job
Invoke Tcl procedures at regular intervals.
.TP
.B Tnm::map
Create and manipulate network maps.
.TP
.B Tnm::mib
Load and query SNMP MIB definitions.
.TP
.B Tnm::netdb
Access the local network databases.
.TP
.B Tnm::ntp
Retrieve control variables from NTP peers.
.TP
.B Tnm::snmp
Send SNMP messages to devices on the Internet.
.TP
.B Tnm::sunrpc
Call and probe selected Sun RPC services.
.TP
.B Tnm::syslog
Write messages to the system logger.
.TP
.B Tnm::udp
Send and receive UDP datagrams.

.SH USING THE TNM EXTENSION 

The Tnm extension can be used with any Tcl interpreter that supports
dynamic loadable modules. The recommended way to load the Tnm extension
is to use the Tcl package command:

.CS
package require Tnm 3.0
.CE

Tcl will automatically search for the pkgIndex.tcl file of the Tnm
extension. This file describes the loading procedure. Once the Tnm
extension has been loaded into the running process, the Tnm
initialization procedure starts. This initialization procedure is
controlled by the init.tcl files in the Tnm library directory.

All of the Tnm commands listed above live in the ::Tnm namespace. You
can use them directly by calling them with the Tnm:: prefix, or you
can import them into your current namespace using the Tnm import
command. A script, which would like to use the Tnm::icmp command
would for example evaluate

.CS
namespace import Tnm::icmp
.CE

in order to get the Tnm::icmp command registered into the local
namespace. You can import all the exported Tnm commands by using the
following command:

.CS
namespace import Tnm::*
.CE

.SH ADDITIONAL PACKAGES

The Tnm package comes with a set of utility packages that simplify the
implementation of management applications. Every package comes with
its own man page which describes the exported Tcl procedures. The
following packages are provided:
.TP 14
.B TnmDialog
A collection of Tcl/Tk dialog boxes.
.TP
.B TnmIetf
A database of information about IETF RFCs and working groups.
.TP
.B TnmInet
A Tcl package to use and probe TCP/IP services.
.TP
.B TnmMap
A collection of utilities for Tnm maps.
.TP
.B TnmMib
A collection of utilities to retrieve SNMP MIB information.
.TP
.B TnmSnmp
A collection of utilities to talk to SNMP agents.
.TP
.B TnmTerm
A simple terminal frequently used to display results.

.SH TCL VARIABLES
The Tnm extension defines the following global Tcl variables:
.TP 18
\fBtnm(library)\fR
The path to the Tnm library directory. This variable is
initialized to the compiled in default. You can overwrite this
default by setting the TNM_LIBRARY environment variable.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(version)\fR
The version number of the Tnm extension.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(arch)\fR
A string that identifies the architecture and operating system.
Note, this will only work with Tcl version 7.5 and higher.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(host)\fR
The name of the local host executing the Tcl process.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(domain)\fR
The DNS domain name of the local host executing the Tcl process.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(user)\fR
The name of the user running the Tcl process.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(mibs)\fR
This variable contains a list of SNMP MIB files that are loaded
automatically if not preceded by a mib load command.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(mibs:core)\fR
This variable contains a list of core SNMP MIB files that are
loaded even if the first mib command is a load command.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(tclsh)\fR
This variable contains the path to the tclsh program on this system.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(wish)\fR
This variable contains the path to the wish program on this system
if the Tnm extension is loaded into a Tcl interpreter with the Tk
extension.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(tmp)\fR
This variable contains the path to a directory where temporary files
can be created.
.TP 18
\fBtnm(cache)\fR
This variable contains the path to a directory where the Tnm extension
caches intermediate files, such as frozen SNMP MIB files. The default
value of this path is ~/.tnm$tnm(version).
