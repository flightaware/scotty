    * fix the call to syslog to specify a format of "%s" and the text
      as an argument to that, rather than the text argument being
      interpreted as the format, which could cause unwanted %-substitutions

2/13/08 karl
    * Fix numerous compiler warnings about discarding qualifiers on pointers.

2/5/08 karl
    * Add README for configuring with FreeBSD.

2/4/08 karl
    * Fix formatting on the UDP manpage.

7/16/07 karl
    * unix/configure.in: Modernize the check for socklen_t to work with
      with versions of autoconf created after 1999.  As an added feature,
      the check is more likely to actually work!


12/7/06 karl
    * tnm/snmp/tnmSnmpRecv.c: Take out the thing where it copies over
      the from address with the address read from within the trap
      packet received.  This quotes NAT addresses through firewalls
      that otherwise would have been translated, that is, un-messed-with,
      we'd be using the IP we received the packet from and all would
      be well.
