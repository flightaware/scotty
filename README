Welcome to the Scotty Tcl extension

by Juergen Schoenwaelder and many contributors.

1. Introduction:
----------------

You are looking at the source tree of scotty, a software package which
allows to build network management applications using Tcl (and
Tk). The scotty package includes the Tnm Tcl extension which provides
Tcl commands to

	- send and receive ICMP packets
	- query the Domain Name System (DNS)
	- access UDP sockets from Tcl
	- probe and use some selected SUN RPCs
	- retrieve and serve documents via HTTP
	- send and reveice SNMP messages (SNMPv1, SNMPv2C, SNMPv3)
	- write special purpose SNMP agents in Tcl
	- parse and access SNMP MIB definitions
	- schedule jobs that are to be done regularly
	- realize event driven programming on network maps

This scotty distributions also includes the sources for Tkined. Tkined
is a network editor which allows to draw maps showing your network
configuration. The most important feature of Tkined is its programming
interface which allows network management applications to extend the
capabilities of Tkined. Most applications for Tkined are written using
the Tnm Tcl extension.

2. Documentation:
-----------------

The "doc" subdirectory contains manual pages for the scotty package.
and the optional features. The most important ones are the Tnm.n page
which gives an overview over the Tcl commands provided by the Tnm
extension and the tkined.1 page which describes the Tkined network
editor. You should be able to read them after installation with the
UNIX "man" command, assuming your MANPATH contains the installation
directory.

An overview about the Tnm extension has been presented at the 3rd
Tcl/Tk workshop in 1995. A PostScript copy of this paper is available
at <http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/schoenw/papers/tcltk-95.ps.gz>.

There is also a manual page for Tkined in the "doc" subdirectory. A
short description of the API which is used to write new applications 
for the Tkined editor is available in the ined.n page.

Some more general experience from doing this project over several
years were presented at the 1st European Tcl/Tk User Meeting in
2000. A PostScript copy of this paper is also available at
<http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/schoenw/papers/tcltk-eu-2000.ps.gz>

3. Compiling and installing Tcl:
--------------------------------

This release requires Tcl8.4 and Tk8.4. You will find the latest
version of these packages at <http://www.tcl.tk/> and many mirror
sites around the globe. Note, this scotty version will most likely not
work with later versions of Tcl and Tk.

This release contains everything you need to compile and run scotty
and tkined with Tcl8.4 and Tk8.4. To compile, change to the "unix"
subdirectory and follow the instructions in the README file in that
directory for compiling scotty and tkined, installing it, and running
the test suite. There is experimental code to compile scotty/tkined on
32 bit Windows platforms in the "win" subdirectory. See the README
in the "win" subdirectory for more details.

4. Additional Information:
--------------------------

There is a mailing list which is used to announce new versions, to
distribute small patches or discuss everything related to the Tnm
extension and the Tkined network editor. To subscribe to this list,
send a message to

	<tkined-request@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de> 

and follow the instructions. Additional information is available on
the Web at the following URL:

	<http://wwwsnmp.cs.utwente.nl/~schoenw/scotty/>

These Web pages include release notes, pointer to related material, a
list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) and the mailing list archive.

5. Support and bug fixes:
-------------------------

We are generally interested in receiving bug reports or suggestions
for improvements. When reporting bugs, please provide a good
description how to reproduce the bug and indicate which version of Tcl
and Scotty you are using plus the operating system name and version.
Bugs with a detailed bug report are usually fixed soon.

The fastest way to get bug fixed is of course to provide a
patch. Patches should be submitted as unified context diffs (diff -u)
rather than complete files to this list for the following reasons:

- Complete files makes it hard for readers to find the places where
  actually changes have been made.

- Complete files just waste bandwidth and storage space.

- Long messages are sorted out by mailman and require approval.

The easiest way to provide patches in in fact to grab the CVS sources
and to produce a diff using "cvs diff" (and of course, you want to put
something like "diff -u" into your ~/.cvsrc. Also do not forget to
send patches for the documentation or test cases in case you patch
changes the Tcl API in any way.

We can't provide much individual support for users. If you have some
problems that you can't solve by reading the man pages, please make
sure that it is not a Tcl related question (e.g. a quoting problem)
before you send mail to the mailing list (the preferred way to ask
questions as there are people who can help even if we are not on the
Internet).

6. Contributors:
----------------

Scotty started very simple as a readline Tcl frontend when there was
no standard tclsh available. I added commands to access network
information when I started work on the network editor Tkined. Scotty
grew up in the last years and many people contributed ideas, patches
or complete modules to this package. Below is a list of contributors
(hopefully not too incomplete) in no particular order.

. The dns command and the icmp server ntping were written by Erik
  Schoenfelder <schoenfr@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de> who also helped me to fix 
  bugs and to enhance portability.

. Stefan Schoek <schoek@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de> contributed the simple job
  scheduler. It was rewritten by me but the ideas were taken from his
  original Tcl version.

. Sven Schmidt <vschmidt@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de> did the original SNMP
  implementation.

. Michael Kernchen <kernchen@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de> wrote the GDMO parser
  and the CMIP Tcl interface based on the OSIMIS/ISODE MSAP API.

  Guntram also wrote an application called tkgraphs which inspired the
  GRAPH object type and the diagram window.

. Erik Schoenfelder <schoenfr@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de> contributed ideas that
  really improved the tkined interface. He is also a very good tester.

. Thanks to Brian Bartholomew <bb@math.ufl.edu> for some interesting
  proposals and Henning G. Schulzrinne <hgs@research.att.com> for some
  bug reports.

. Many thanks to Mark Weissman <weissman@gte.com> for making his emacs
  key bindings available, although they are not used anymore.

. Dieter Rueffler <dieter@prz.tu-berlin.de> proposed to integrate
  "hyperlinks" to remote tkined maps using URLs. The idea is now
  implemented as reference objects.

. Juergen Luksch <luksch@telenet.de> reported compilation problems on
  SCO machines and provided some suggestions on how to fix them.

  lists to the mailing list. This usually causes a lot of work but is
  always appreciated.

  eval command which allows a script to play with internals from tkined.

. Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@freebsd.org> contributed some changes
  to the topology discovering application.

Many thanks to all the bug reports and suggestions reported to me or 
the tkined mailing list.
