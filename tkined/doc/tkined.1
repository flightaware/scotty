.SH NAME
tkined \- An Interactive Network Editor based on Tk.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtkined\fR ?\fIfile1 file2 ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
Tkined is an interactive editor for creating and maintaining network
maps.  Tkined is programmable and can therefore be used as a graphical
frontend for quite a number of applications that normally act on a
network map (e.g. network management systems, network simulators).
Applications run as separate processes that communicate with tkined
through a simple protocol. The most common way to implement a tkined
application is to use the network management extension Tnm(n) for the
Tool Command Language Tcl(n) which encapsulated the protocol and
provides access to the editor using the ined(n) Tcl command.

Tkined has evolved from the original ined editor which was written on
top of the Unidraw/Interviews framework. Tkined in its current form is
a set of Tk(1) scripts and some C code that handles the internal state
of tkined objects.

This man page is intended to provide a short overview over menus
provided by the Tkined editor.

.SH FILE MENU
The File menu contains commands to save, load or print network maps.
.TP 18
.B Clear
Clear the current map.
.TP
.B Open...
Load a previously saved map. The saved map file contains a script of
ined commands that will reconstruct the map. Loading a map may also
restart tkined applications.
.TP
.B Merge...
Merge a previously saved map into the current map.
.TP
.B Save...
Save the current map to the current file name. Tkined will write into
the file named noname.tki if you never specified a different file name.
.TP
.B Save As...
Save the current map after choosing a new file name.
.TP
.B Print...
Print or store the current network map in PostScript format. You are
prompted to enter a print command or to select a file name which will
capture the PostScript output.
.TP
.B Import...
Import a background image. The image file must have the X11 bitmap
format.
.TP
.B History...
The editor maintains a history of recently used map files in 
~/.tkined/.history. The history command allows to open a map file
from the list of recently used tkined maps. This allows to jump from
map to map very quickly.
.TP
.B New View
Create a new view. This looks much like spawning a new tkined process,
but a new view allows you to copy and paste between the views and
saves some resources.
.TP
.B Close View
Close the tkined view. The tkined process will exit if you close the
last tkined view.
.PP

.SH SELECT MENU
The Select menu contains commands that modify the set of currently
selection objects.
.TP 18
.B Select All
This command selects all objects shown on the canvas.
.TP
.B Select Neighbours
Add all objects linked directly to a selected object to the current selection.
.TP
.B Select Member
Add all member of all selected groups to the current selection.
.TP
.B Select by Type
Add all objects of a given type to the current selection.
.TP
.B Select by Name
Query the user for a regular or glob style expression and add all
objects to the current selection whose name matches the expression.
.TP
.B Select by Address
Query the user for a regular or glob style expression and add all 
objects to the current selection whose address matches the expression.
.TP
.B Select by Label
Query the user for a regular or glob style expression and add all 
objects to the current selection whose current label contents matches 
the expression.
.TP
.B Select by Attribute
Query the user for an attribute and a regular or glob style expression
and add all objects to the current selection where the content of
the selected attribute matches the expression.
.PP


The Edit menu contains the following commands for editing maps.
.TP 18
.B Attribute->Create
Create a new attribute for all selected objects (also avail by Button
3 popup menu).
.TP
.B Attribute->Delete
Delete an attribute from all selected objects, if existing (also avail
by Button 3 popup menu).
.TP
.B Attribute->Edit
Change an attribute for all selected objects.
.TP
.B Set Label
Set the label of all selected objects the value of an attribute.
.TP
.B Scale Factor

.B Grid Spacing
Set the spacing between grid points in pixel.
.TP
.B Align to Grid
Align the selected objects on the grid. Objects not selected will not
be touched.
.TP
.B Undo
Undo the last change you made. Note that undo currently cannot
undo a delete command. If you are not sure you really want to delete,
use the cut command (see below).
.TP
.B Redo
Redo the last undone change. A sequence like undo undo redo redo
should always bring you back in the initial state.
.TP
.B Delete
Delete the current selection. All objects will get lost since this
command does not update the undo buffer.
.TP
.B Cut
Delete the current selection and place all deleted objects on the clipboard.
The clipboard is a global buffer shared by all views. You can use the cut 
command to copy objects form one view to another.
.TP
.B Copy
Copy the current selection on the clipboard without deleting the objects
from the current view.
.TP
.B Paste
Paste the objects stored on the clipboard into the current view.
.PP
The Structure menu contains commands to modify the structure of the
map.
.TP 18
.B Bring to Front
Bring the selected objects to the front of the map. Background images 
ignore this command.
.TP
.B Send to Back
Send the selected objects to the back of the map.
.TP
.B Group
Create a new group object. The current selection will become
the members of the new group object.
.TP
.B Ungroup
Delete a group object. The member of the group will become
visible again or the group frame will be deleted if the group
is currently expanded.
.TP
.B Collapse
Collapse an expanded group to show its icon. A new group is always
initially collapsed.
.TP
.B Expand

select the objects to add and the group to add to. A dialog will ask you
to select the parent group if there are ambiguities.
.TP
.B Leave Group
All selected objects will be removed from any group they belong to.

.PP
The Icon menu contains six sub menus allowing to manipulate the appearance
of tkined objects.
.TP 18

The Color sub menu contains symbolic names for the colors available.
This sub menu will only appear if you are working on a color display.
Tkined will map all colors to black if your application or your saved 
map expects color definitions and you are sitting in front of a 
monochrome display.
.PP
The Options menu allows you to set the page size and orientation and
offers some checkbuttons to control the look-and-feel of tkined.

.TP
.B Lock Editor
Locking the editor disallows creation and deletion of objects. You can
Unlock the editor by turning the Lock Editor switch off again.
.TP
.B Memory Validation
If you have compiled and installed the Tk/Tcl libraries and tkined
with the memory validation define, this toggle enables/disables
memory validation.
.bt
Note: Memory validation is very time consuming and at least not even
recommended for debugging.
.TP
.B Memory Trace
If you have compiled and installed the Tk/Tcl libraries and tkined
with the memory validation define set, this toggles enable/disable of
memory allocation tracing. Trace information is written to stderr of
tkined.
.TP
.B Memory Info
If you have compiled and installed the Tk/Tcl libraries and tkined
with the memory validation define set, this prints some memory usage
statistics to stderr of tkined.
.TP
.B Strict Motif
Toggle tkined's appearance between a nicer motif-like and strict motif
look-and-feel, as done by John within tk.
.PP
The Help menu contains some infos about the editor and some short help
texts.
.TP 18
.B General
General information about tkined.
.TP
.B Status
Some status information about the editor. This is mainly for maintenance.
.TP
.B Key Bindings
A short note about the key bindings inside the canvas. This may
help you to learn about the various ways to use the mouse buttons.
.PP

.SH CUSTOMIZATION

You can customize the tkined editor to your specific needs. You may
load your own icon bitmaps and define the width of various network
types.  All customization is done using tkined.defaults files, that
are very similar to xrdb(1) files. Since there is no way to access the
defaults database of the server from within tk, the defaults files are
searched in the current directory, ~/.tkined, $tkined(library)/site
and $tkined(library) in this order.

.TP 18 
.B width
.ns
.TP
.B height
You can specify the default width and height of the drawing area 
using the with and height attribute.

.TP
.B node i 
You may specify icons to represent machines for the i-th node menu
entry. The definition consists of two strings. The first one is the
filename of the bitmap and the second is the name of the icon as shown
in the node menu. A colon can be used to create a path of submenus,
e.g. Sun:SparcStation 2.

.TP 
.B group i 
The definition of an icon for a collapsed group is done in the same
way as for a node icon.

.TP 
.B network i 
The definition of the i-th network consists of the line thickness to
use and the name that appears in the menu.

.TP 
.B reference i 
The definition of an icon for a reference object is done in the same
way as for a node icon.

.TP 
.B interpreter i 
The i-th interpreter is defined by its file name. It is the
responsibility of the interpreter to define new menus using the 
ined create MENU command.

.TP 
.B font i 
The font menu is build using the font definitions. The i-th menu entry
represents font i which must be given as an X11 font name followed by
the name used in the font menu.

.TP
.B color i
The contents of the color menu is given by an X11 color name and the
name for this color used in the color menu. The color menu does not
appear on monochrome displays.
