Bugs
====

* Generic
    * Build
         * Should we revamp directory tree of installed files to
		 reflect FHS or so (`share` instead of `library` ...)?
         * We could clean things up, and put in order, as we now
         build everything ok.

Tests
=====

- Debian
    - tkined starts up, but the Tools menu is not shown.  This seems
      due to the fact, that any `ined` command is hanging in the
      initialization scripts, until the main editor window is closed.
	  Event loop?

Wishlist
========

- Port to:
  - OpenIndiana (Solaris)
  - Windows
