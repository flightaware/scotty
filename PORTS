This file is part of the _scotty_ Tcl extension for network
management.  It describes how to build on different platforms.

Debian
======

Needed packages to be install with `apt-get`:

    build-essentials tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev

Configure with:

    ./configure


Alpine Linux
============

From a default install to _scotty_ on [Alpine Linux][] you need to
install the following packages with `apk add`:

    build-base linux-headers tcl-dev tk-dev libtirpc-dev

Configure the build with:

    ./configure --with-tirpc

Alpine Linux does not build against the GNU C Library (glibc), instead
it uses the [musl libc][].  _musl_ does not feature a complete Sun RPC
implementation, but Alpine packages the [tirpc][] library which can be
used instead.  It is supposed, that you can build _scotty_ against
_tirpc_ on any platform, where this library is available.

FreeBSD
=======

Required packages to be installed with `pkg install`:

    tcl86-8.6.6_2 tk86-8.6.6

Configure with:

    ./configure


MacOSX
======

Install [Active State Tcl][], the community edition will do.  It will
install the development files in `/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework`
and `/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework`.

Install [Xcode][] from Apple.

Configure with:

    ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/bin/ --libdir=/Library/Tcl
