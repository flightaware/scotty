This file is part of the _scotty_ Tcl extension for network
management.  It describes how to build on different platforms.

Debian, Ubuntu
==============

Needed packages to be install with `apt-get`:

    build-essentials tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev autoconf

Configure with:

    ./configure


Alpine Linux
============

From a default install to _scotty_ on [Alpine Linux][] you need to
install the following packages with `apk add`:

    build-base linux-headers tcl-dev tk-dev libtirpc-dev

Configure the build with:

    ./configure --with-tirpc

Alpine Linux does not build against the GNU C Library (glibc), instead
it uses the [musl libc][].  _musl_ does not feature a complete Sun RPC
implementation, but Alpine packages the [tirpc][] library which can be
used instead.  It is supposed, that you can build _scotty_ against
_tirpc_ on any platform, where this library is available.
